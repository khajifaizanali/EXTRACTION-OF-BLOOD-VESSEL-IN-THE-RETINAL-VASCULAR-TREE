# EXTRACTION-OF-BLOOD-VESSEL-IN-THE-RETINAL-VASCULAR-TREE

Diabetic retinopathy is a disease, which forms a severe threat on sight. It may
reach to blindness among working age people. By analysing and detecting of
vasculature structures in retinal images, we can early detect the diabetes in advanced stages by comparison of its states of retinal blood vessels.
In this paper, we present blood vessel segmentation approach, which can be
used in computer based retinal image analysis to extract the retinal image vessels. Mathematical morphology and K-means clustering are used to segment
the vessels. To enhance the blood vessels and suppress the background information, we perform smoothing operation on the retinal image using mathematical
morphology. Then the enhanced image is segmented using K- means clustering algorithm. The proposed approach is tested on the DRIVE dataset and is
compared with alternative approaches. Experimental results obtained by the
proposed approach showed that it is effective as it achieved average accuracy of
95.10
# Introduction
Among the modern health care community, medical imaging has become the
most important tool; this is because of the visual documentation and record
storing for the patients and for its ability to information extraction about many
diseases. For retinal image analysis, there are several applications, such as diabetic retinopathy, where it can be used in addition to their important roles
in some diseases detection in early stages. Because of segmentation of retinal
image structures using in modern ophthalmology as a non-invasive diagnosis;
it has been a very interested topic. For retinal diseases such as hypertension,
diabetic retinopathy, hemorrhages, macular degeneration, glaucoma, neovascularization and vein occlusion, working on the optic disc and the retinal blood
vessel morphology is one of the basic indicators for assessing the presence and
severity for each of these diseases
